# 👋 Hii, I’m Myra!

I’m a CS undergrad at NYU Abu Dhabi, and I’m all about building tech that *actually* makes a difference.  
You’ll usually find me somewhere between data science and EdTech,   
chasing questions like *“how can we use AI for good?”* and *“what if this was just... better?”*

### 💻 What I’ve been working on:
- Research @ NYUAD’s AIR Lab on accessible AI for the Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing (👋 ChatSign!)
- Data science projects exploring climate, health, and demographic data
- Hackathon builds with just enough chaos to be brilliant

### 🛠 Tech I like:
Python, R, Pandas, Figma, Post-it notes, and whiteboards that are 90% doodles

### 🌱 Always learning:
Making sense of messy data, testing new tools, and leveling up my CS + math + econ + data brain (because I definitely have too many interests)

Let’s build something meaningful :)) ✨
